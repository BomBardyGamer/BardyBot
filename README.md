The next generation Discord music bot that responds and acts like a human! You can report issues using the GitHub
issue tracker for self-hosting and programming issues [here](https://github.com/BomBardyGamer/BardyBot/issues),
or via the YouTrack issue tracker for general problems with functionality and feature requests 
[here](https://youtrack.prevarinite.com/issues?q=project:%20BardyBot).

BardyBot is licensed under the highly permissive MIT license, enabling anyone to use it and edit it without needing
any explicit permission! You are more than welcome to do so, and it would make my day to see others making use of
my bot and it's code.

## Self-Hosting

For those of you who want to host your own version of the bot using your own bot application, you can do so either
using the Docker image from the Docker Hub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/bombardygamer/bardybot) to run it in a
Docker container (recommended), or via downloading the JAR file from the latest build available from the CI server
[here](https://ci.prevarinite.com/job/BardyBot).

You can also find a detailed description of the application.yml (configuration file) [here](https://youtrack.prevarinite.com/articles/BB-A-1/Configuring-the-bot-for-self-hosters)
